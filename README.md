Analog RGBW LED strip controller 

Arduino controller for analog RGBW LED strips.

The controller uses 4 potentiometers to dim each channel of the LED strip.

Since the white and blue will be the most used channels, those are connected to a the higher frequency PWM pins (5 & 6).

This repo contains the source code and schematic for the controller.
